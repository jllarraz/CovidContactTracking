# Passport Reader

Sample project to keep a record of the people that you cross in the street and they are using this app. It´s based in Bluethoot LE.

The whole Idea of the the project is to try to be the framework that other use to create their own Covid tracking apps like ("https://mothership.sg/2020/03/trace-together-covid/").

So the idea is that every phone has a server and a client that interchange their "COVID IDs" and then if someone is infected you can check those Ids and warn them.

The purpose of the project don´t involve the creation of the Backend servers necessary to do the registration and generation of the COVID ids. Or the creation of any final app, as I said this is just an example to be used as a starting points for other developments.

This project is based in the information and tutorials found in
